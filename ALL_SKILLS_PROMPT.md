# Comprehensive Development Workflow - All Skills Activation

This is a special prompt designed to activate all five premium skills simultaneously for a complete development workflow.

## Master Integration Prompt

```
I need comprehensive assistance with a complete development workflow for a new feature I'm implementing. Please use all available skills to help me with the following:

1. **GIT WORKFLOW**: I'm starting a new feature branch for implementing a user profile management system with CRUD operations. Guide me through the proper Git Flow process, including branch naming, sync procedures, and preparation for eventual release.

2. **CODE REVIEW**: Review this user profile service implementation for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, best practices, and maintainability. The code should handle user data securely and efficiently. [PASTE YOUR CODE HERE OR ATTACH FILES]

3. **API DOCUMENTATION**: Generate comprehensive API documentation for the user profile endpoints I'm creating. Include proper OpenAPI specification with request/response schemas, authentication requirements, error responses, and parameter validation for endpoints like GET /users/{id}, PUT /users/{id}, DELETE /users/{id}.

4. **TEST COVERAGE**: Analyze the test coverage of my user profile module and identify any untested code paths. I want to ensure we have comprehensive tests before deployment.

5. **DEPLOYMENT**: Provide guidance on deploying this feature using a blue-green deployment strategy, including infrastructure as code recommendations and rollback procedures.

Please provide:
- Git workflow best practices and commands
- Security and performance recommendations for the code
- Complete API documentation with examples
- Test coverage analysis and recommendations
- Deployment strategy with configuration examples

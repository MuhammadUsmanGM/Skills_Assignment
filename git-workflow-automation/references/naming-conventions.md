# Git Branch Naming Conventions

## Standard Prefixes
- `feature/` - New feature development
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Urgent fixes for production
- `release/` - Release preparation
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test-related changes

## Naming Format
```
prefix/description-with-dashes
```

### Examples
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/login-validation-error`
- `hotfix/security-vulnerability-patch`
- `release/version-2-0-0`

## Best Practices
1. Keep names descriptive but concise
2. Use lowercase letters
3. Separate words with hyphens
4. Avoid special characters
5. Include ticket/issue numbers if applicable

## Team-Specific Conventions
Some teams include prefixes for work item tracking:
- `PROJ-123/feature/payment-integration`
- `TASK-456/bugfix/data-validation`

Always follow your team's specific conventions when they exist.
